    "It was soon recognized that Lean and Agile were (mostly) saying the same thing, so that the Poppendieck's, for instance, published a book titled *Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The adoption of lean and agile techniques enabled software developers to rapidly produce new versions of a software system. But there remained a barrier to getting those new versions out to the user: **Operations**!\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Operations\" is the name for the IT role in an organization that is concerned with keeping the organization's systems up and *operating*. And operations had learned, from hard experience, that new releases meant new problems, perhaps, indeed, weeks of support calls and system crashes. And since it was operations that had to answer those calls and recover from those crashes, operations wanted as few new releases of software as possible. But these darned new agile/lean programmers wanted to release more and more often.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, there were some forward-thinking operations people who thought, \"Well, rather than trying to hold the developers back, why don't we make operations agile as well?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "One of those people was Patrick Debois, who organized a conference to bring developers and operations people together. He happened to call it a \"DevOps\" conference... and the term caught on, and became the name for \"bringing lean and agile to operations.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "I often tell the students in my DevOps class that a better name than \"DevOps\" might be: \"Modern Software Engineering.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "And thus, we will try to \"DevOps\" our projects as we work on them."
