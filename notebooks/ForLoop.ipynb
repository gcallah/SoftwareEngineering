    "\"for each\" is a common name for this kind of loop, even though in Python the word \"each\" does not appear in the code. The name comes from the fact that this sort of loop repeats some code *for each* item in some *sequence*. So let's say you have a *list* (a type of sequence) of numbers (details on lists come a little later in this course, but the basic idea here should be pretty intuitive), and you want to square each one and print the result. You can do this:"
