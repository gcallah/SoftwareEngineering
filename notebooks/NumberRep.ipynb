    "We typically represent numbers in base-10. Speculation is that's because of the number of fingers we have. But base-20, base-60, and base-33 have all [been used in the past] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_numeral_systems).\n",

    "/////.\n",
    "\n",
    "Base-1 is fine if we are tallying wins in dice or *Yu-Gi-Oh!*, but what if our bank kept our account balance in a tally system? If you have a million dollars in the bank, your account balance statement would consist of one million tally marks! It would take about 200 pages to print your account statement just to show the balance, and it would be very hard to know if the bank were cheating you!\n",

    "The Roman numeral system is probably somewhat familiar to you. It is actually partially unary: 1, 2 and 3 are *I*, *II*, and *III*. Five is *V*, while four is \"5 - 1,\" designated by putting the *I* before the *V*: *IV*. Then 6, 7 and 8 go back to unary: *VI*, *VII*, *VIII*. Ten is *X*, while nine is \"10 - 1\": *IX*.\n",

    "Things get much better when we line numbers up in positions according to some *base* factor, and have the idea of *zero* available for when some place is missing. These are called [positional systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_notation). So, in base ten, we have, on the far right, the *units* place, followed by the *tens* place, the *hundreds* place, the *thousands* place, and so on. With this system, we can use the same digits over and over again, to represent a number however big we want. So:"
