# An Introduction to Agile and DevOps Development

## The Background

### The Ford / Taylor Factory Model

[Frederick Winslow Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Winslow_Taylor)


This was taken to be the best practice for production, so naturally managers tried to apply it to software.

The result was:

![Waterfall model diagram](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Waterfall_model.svg/700px-Waterfall_model.svg.png)

"The waterfall development model originated in the manufacturing and
construction industries,[citation needed] where the highly structured physical
environments meant that design changes became prohibitively expensive much
sooner in the development process.[citation needed] When first adopted for
software development, there were no recognized alternatives for knowledge-based
creative work." -- Wikipedia

[Failed waterfall projects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_failed_and_overbudget_custom_software_projects)

My failed project stories.

Why did the Waterfall Model fail so often and so spectacularly?

* Users often don't know what they want until they see a product.
* The competitive environment changes as the product is being developed.
* The legal environment changes as the product is being developed.
* The natural environment changes as the product is being developed.
* Wordy specifications written in English don't translate nicely to commands in a software language.
* Programmers who are expected to be mere typing machines will not understand what the requirements mean, since they
    lack context.


## The Alternative

How did an alternative to the waterfall model arise? It will be useful to follow some history to understand what
happened.

### Toyota

Interestingly, the way forward from these rigid production methods was actually pioneered in the auto industry, by the
Japanese company Toyota, and its
[Toyota Production System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Production_System), one of the earliest examples of
[lean production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing).

Notable features:

* Pull rather than push system.
* All employees contribute ideas, not just "plant engineers" or managers.
* Catch defects early.
* Work in small batches.
* Limit work in progress.


### UNIX

Development on the UNIX operating system began at AT&T in 1969. It is almost certainly the world's most successful
software project: it was developed very cheaply at first, by only a handful of developers, has been in continuous
development every since, and today, UNIX and its descendants, such as Linux, MacOS, Andriod, and iOS, dominate the world
of operating systems.

What accounts for the success of UNIX?

* Deliver an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) as soon as possible.
* Get user feedback.
* Just add the features users really want.
* Develop incrementally: create multiple small tools that each do a small job.

### Lean

Mary Popendieck What is a product development manager at 3M, A company which had adapted, lean manufacturing and product
development. When she was put in charge of the software project, she was shocked at the idea that the team should begin
by writing a huge requirements document. She miss used to product developers building simple versions of an idea getting
feedback from customers right away. She and her husband, Tom adapted this approach to software development, pioneering
the concept of [Lean software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development).

### Agile

At roughly the same time as Lean was being developed, a group of developers, often from the UNIX world, were developing
the concept of [Agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development).

Key agile principles:

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
* Working software over comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to change over following a plan

[Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org)

I would say that Lean and Agile are basically two different names for the same approach to developing software.

### DevOps
