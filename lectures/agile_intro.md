"The waterfall development model originated in the manufacturing and
construction industries,[citation needed] where the highly structured physical
environments meant that design changes became prohibitively expensive much
sooner in the development process.[citation needed] When first adopted for
software development, there were no recognized alternatives for knowledge-based
creative work." -- Wikipedia

## The Alternative

How did an alternative to the waterfall model arise? It will be useful to follow some history to understand what
happened.

### Toyota

Interestingly, the way forward from these rigid production methods was actually pioneered in the auto industry, by the
Japanese company Toyota, and its
[Toyota Production System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Production_System), one of the earliest examples of
[lean production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing).

Notable features:

* Pull rather than push system.
* All employees contribute ideas, not just "plant engineers" or managers.
* Catch defects early.
* Work in small batches.
* Limit work in progress.
