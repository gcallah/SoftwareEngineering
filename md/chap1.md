# Chapter 1: Introduction

## Preface 

You might be wondering, why should I study software engineering? Walk down the
street of New York City or around NYU's campuses and you will probably see few
people who are not on their phones or on their laptops. Every one of these
techonology runs on some form of software system; in fact it should be no
suprise that software engineering is vital to everyday life as the whole world
is run by computer systems. 

Thus, the idea of software engineering was born in order to teach engineers the
theories and methods/tools to create and maintain the software used to run the
world. However do note that there are different methods of software engineering
and not one method is the end all be all. Like how you use different
screwdrivers for different screws, different software engineering methods and
techniqeus are more suitable for different systems. By honing and using these
techniques efficiently, you can then create your system in an orderly and
efficient matter while cutting down on the cost to create the system which is
another concern that software engineering tackles. Software costs often cost
more than the physical system or hardware itself. In fact, more times than not
the maintence of software can cost several times more than the cost to actually
develop the software; thus software engineering aims to also help reduce the
cost to develop and maintain software. 

Two potential ways that software projects fail include (textbook pg. 18): 
* **Increasing system complexity**
  * New software engineering techniques have to be made in order to meet new future larger and more complex systems.
* **Failure to use software engineering methods**
  * Not using software engineering practices can lead to more expensive and less reliable software. 



## 1.1 Professional software development



### What is Software Engineering 

![FAQ](../images/chap/1.1_faq.png)

Software engineering is a discipline that encompasses the very start of
creation of the software to even beyond its completition and into the maintence
of the software. There are two important concepts to keep in mind about what is
the core of software engineering (textbook pg. 21-22):

* **Engineering discpline**
* **All aspects of software production**

As stated in the preface, software engineering is important because: 
* More people are relying on software syystems 
* It is cheaper to use such techniques for professional systems as it generally
has quality assurance, lowers cost, and is good for long-term maintence. 



Sofware produced can be split into two categories (textbook pg. 20-21):
* **Generic products**
  * These are stand-alone general-purpose products sold to any customers/consumers 
  * Ex) PC software such as graphics/art programs, project management tools
  * Ex) Software for specific markets/groups for general use such as appointment systems for dentists
* **Customized or bespoke products**
  * These are tools commisoned by a specific customer to meet their own unique
  needs.
  * Ex) Systems written to a particular business process, or air traffic
  control systems.

The main difference between these categorization is who specifies what are the requirements for the software. 
In the case of a generic product, the software developers
control the specification and can choose how and what is needed to be made for
their product as there product is for general use and not for a specialized case. 
In the case of customized prodcuts, the client/consumer are
the ones that outline the specification and requirements that the developers
need to follow. 

In order for the software to be deemed as good, it must follow four principles: 
* **Acceptability**
  * The software must be usable for its consumer (whether it means it can run on the customer's systems or if meets the needs of the customer).
* **Dependability and security**
  * The software must not be harmful to the consumer and do not allow any malicious users or criminals to be able to tamper with the software.
* **Efficiency**
  * The software should not waste resources but instead be able to utilize them well and be repsonsive.
* **Maintainability**
  * The software should be able to address any future changes the consumer may need. 

In order to create such softwares that follow these four princples, the
software process (a sequence of activities that is used to produce a software)
must include four fundamental acitivies (textbook pg. 23): 

* **Software specification**:
  * Customers and developers define what software is to be built, what functionalities it will have, and what constraints it will have
* **Software development**
  * The stage in which the software is made.
* **Software validation**
  * The softawre is checked to see if it meets its specification
* **Software evolution**
  * The stage where software is maintained in order to meet future changes in its requirements and specification

During the softare process, there are four issues taht may affect what type of software you produce (textbook pg. 24):

* **Heterogeniety**
* **Business and social change**
* **Security and trust**
* **Scale**

### Computer Science vs Software engineering

Computer science studies the *formal* properties of *computations*.
See [this excellent lecture](https://youtu.be/fpZ_rviHEAo) on what computation
is.


### Software Engineering Diversity

There are many types of systems that can be made which include (textbook pg. 25):
* **Stand-alone applications**
* **Interactive transaction-based applications**
* **Embedded control systems**
* **Batch processing systems**
* **Entertainment systems**
* **Systems for modeling and simulation**
* **Data collection and analysis systems**
* **System of systems**

Despite the diversity of software system types, their are several fundamental
principles that are applicable for all software:

* Systems should be made by using an understood and managed development process.
* Dependability and performance are crucial for the success of all software.
* Developers must understand what the software is for!
* Developers should re-use existing software in preference to writing new programs.

### Internet Software Engineering 

The fact that most software today runs on the Internet introduces new
considerations:

- Does the software work across a variety of user interfaces: popular web
browsers, custom phone apps, and API access from other programs?
- Is the software secure, given the entire world can access it?

The increasing development of the Internet also allows information to be not stored in local drives; 
instead applications such as Microsoft Office 265 and the Google Suite allows users to be able to add and house 
information in remote "clouds". 


## 1.2 Software engineering ethics


### Example professional responsibilities

Similar to how other engineering or science disciplines have an ethic code, 
software engineering has the same. Such resposnibilites include (textbook pg. 28-29):
* **Confidentiality**
* **Competence**
* **Intellectual property rights**
* **Computer misues**


### The Ethic Code and its Eight Principles 

CM and the IEEE are professional associations that created a code of ethics that contains 
eight Principles related to how software engineers should behave and make decisions. 
These eight principles include (textbook pg. 30):
* **Public**
* **Client and Employer**
* **Product**
* **Judgement**
* **Mangement**
* **Profession**
* **Colleagues**
* **Self**
