## Modern Software Engineering

**Goal**: be able to repeatedly and reliably release high quality software that meets the user's needs.

We are able to get rapid feedback and *learn* what our software needs to do.

## When Do We Need It?

We don't always need software engineering. Sometimes "just programming" is fine. And when we do need it, how much is often a matter of degree. We need more software engineering the greater the:

* Lifespan of the project
* Number of people working on the project
* Amount of code in the project

## Aspects of MSE:

* [[Agile versus Waterfall]]
* [[Modularity]]
* Incremental development
* [[Automated builds]]
* [[Automated testing]]
* CI-CD
* [[Special purpose languages]]
